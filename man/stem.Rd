\title{Construct a stem object.}
\usage{
stem(stem_object = NULL, data = NULL, dynamics = NULL,
  stem_settings = NULL, meas_process = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{stem_object}{an existing stochastic epidemic model object to which
model settings should be added.}

\item{data}{a matrix/data frame, or a list of matrices/data frames. All
columns must be named according to which compartment_strata are measured.
The first column must consist of observation times, t_1,...,t_L. If data on
all measured compartments are accrued at the same observation times, a
single matrix or data frame may be provided. If each compartment in the
data was measured at different observation times, a list of matrices or
data frames must be provided. Again, the first column of each matrix must
consist of observation times, while subsequent columns must be labeled
according to which compartments are reflected.}

\item{dynamics}{A list of objects describing the model dynamics, most
straighforwardly generated using the \code{stem_dynamics} function.}

\item{stem_settings}{otional list of inference settings, most
straightforwardly generated using the \code{stem_control} function.}

\item{meas_process}{list of functions to simulate from or evaluate the
likelihood of the measurement process. These are most easily generated
using the \code{stem_measure} function.}

\item{parameters}{Named vector of parameter values.}

\item{strata}{names of model strata.}

\item{constants}{Named vector of constants.}
}
\value{
returns a \code{stem} list.
