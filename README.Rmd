# stemr - Approximate Baysian Inference for Stochastic Epidemic Models via the Linear Noise Approximation
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fintzij/stemr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fintzij/stemr)

Approximate Baysian Inference for Stochastic Epidemic Models via the Linear Noise Approximation.
    Currently implements approximate inference via the linear noise approximation with a suite of adaptive and fixed kernel MCMC algorithms for parameter proposals. Planned development includes an implementation of an agent-based data-driven data augmentation algorithm for efficient subject-level path proposals based on noisy aggregate counts at discrete observation times.
