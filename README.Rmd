# stemr - Fit Stochastic Epidemic Models in R via Bayesian Data Augmentation

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fintzij/stemr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fintzij/stemr)

Fit stochastic epidemic models using Bayesian data augmentation.
    Implements an agent-based data-driven data augmentation algorithm for
    efficient subject-level path proposals based on noisy aggregate counts at
    discrete observation times.
