## Baysian Inference for Stochastic Epidemic Models via the Linear Noise Approximation

The __stemr__ R package implements a Bayesian data augmentation algorithm for 
fitting stochastic epidemic models (SEMs) with arbitrary dynamics to partially 
observed epidemic count data via the linear noise approximation (LNA). This 
repository and package exist to expose and archive the code used in the paper, 
"Outbreak Modeling via the Linear Noise Approximation: Fast Approximations
for Stochastic Epidemic Models Fit to Partially Observed Incidence Counts" 
by J. Fintzi, J. Wakefield, and V.N. Minin. The package provides facilities for 
exact simulation of SEMs via Gillespie's direct algorithm, and for simulation of
approximate epidemic paths via the LNA. Inference is carried out using a Bayesian
data augmentation algorithm. LNA paths are sampled via the elliptical slice 
sampling algorithm of Murray et al. (2010), and the package offers several choices
for adaptive and fixed kernel MCMC algorithms for parameter updates. The package 
also allows for time varying covariates, time varying parameters, and deterministic
forcings. 

## Getting started
This package may be installed directly from GitHub using the __devtools__ package. 
__IMPORTANT__ It is critical that the package is installed with byte compilation 
disabled. The package will not work properly when byte compiled, which is the 
default since R 3.4.

```
library(devtools)
install_github("fintzij/stemr", build_vignettes=TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-byte-compile")) 
library(stemr)
```

There are several vignettes included in this package. The first diagrams the basic 
functionality of the package. The others contain walk-throughs of the simulations 
and analyses presented in the paper. These are accessible as follows:

```
vignette("stemr")
vignette("sir_coverage")
vignette("ebola_westafrica")
```

We also provide vignettes demonstrating how to use the `pomp` package to fit the
models in the coverage simulation and analysis of data from the 2013-2015 
outbreak of Ebola in West Africa. These may be accessed as follows:

```
vignette("sir_pomp")
vignette("ebola_pomp")
```
