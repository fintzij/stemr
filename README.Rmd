## Baysian Inference for Stochastic Epidemic Models via the Linear Noise Approximation

The __stemr__ R package implements a Bayesian data augmentation algorithm for 
fitting stochastic epidemic models (SEMs) with arbitrary dynamics to partially 
observed epidemic count data via the linear noise approximation (LNA). This 
repository and package exist to expose and archive the code used in the paper, 
"A Linear Noise Approximation for Stochastic Epidemic Models Fit to Partially 
Observed Incidence Counts" by J. Fintzi, J. Wakefield, and V.N. Minin. The 
package provides facilities for exact simulation of SEMs via Gillespie's direct 
algorithm, and for simulation of approximate epidemic paths via the LNA. 
Inference is carried out using a Bayesian data augmentation algorithm. LNA paths 
are sampled via the elliptical slice sampling algorithm of Murray et al. (2010), 
and the package  offers several choices for adaptive and fixed kernel MCMC 
algorithms for parameter updates. The package also allows for time varying 
covariates, time varying parameters, and deterministic forcings. These 
functionalities are not yet fully documented, but sample code is available in 
the '/inst' directory on the GitHub repository.

## Package installation
This package may be installed directly from GitHub using the __devtools__ package. 
__IMPORTANT__ It is critical that the package is installed with byte compilation 
disabled. The package will not work properly when byte compiled, which is the 
default since R 3.4.

```
library(devtools)
install_github("fintzij/stemr", build_vignettes=TRUE, build_opts = c("--no-byte-compile")) 
library(stemr)
```

## Vignettes
There are two vignettes included in this package to help familiarize users 
with its basic functionality and that reproduce models the SEMs fit via the LNA 
in Fintzi, et al. (2020). The `stemr_sir` vignette provides an introduction to
the `stemr` package, and demonstrates how to simulate from and fit an SIR model 
via the LNA and ODE. The `ebola_westafrica` vignette demonstrates how to simulate
from and fit a multi-country model for Ebola transmission, and then provides code
to fit the model to data from the 2014-2015 outbreak in West Africa. Both vignettes 
also include annotated `pomp` code for fitting the respective models (version 
1.17 was used as a benchmark in the paper). The vignettes may be accessed as 
follows:
